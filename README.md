Web3 Wallet with Gelato Gasless Wallet and Staking and Range Orders

This is a web3 wallet project that utilizes the Gelato Gasless Wallet and Web3 functions to allow users to interact with the Ethereum network and call contract functions gasslessly.This would help a lot of web2 users to adopt the web3 technology as gas is always one of the biggest hindrance to mass adoption. 

In addition to sending and receiving Ethereum, users can also STAKE their tokens and PLACE RANGE ORDERS.

Buy simpl tokens using eth and stake them on the wallet and reap rewards for doing that.

Give target price for swapping eth for uniswap Token and wait for the price of UNI to rise and watch it get swapped automatically!!!
